# Flank-Wear-Prediction-of-CNC-Lathe-Tool-Insert
Flank wear has been a major concern in case of machining as it contributes in inaccuracy, distortion of surface integrity, increasing chances of tool failure and consequently economic expenditure. Extensive research and experiments have been carried out worldwide in the area of Tool Condition Monitoring in search of an accurate solution. In this project, we have implemented machine learning algorithms like linear regression, decision tree regression and random forest regression from a dataset available online to develop an application, using Anaconda Navigator in Visual Studio Code platform which will predict the flank wear of a tool. The application is expected to provide highest accuracy in order to understand whether a machining environment is suitable or not.
